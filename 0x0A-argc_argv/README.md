For this project, we will learn how to pass arguments to the main function.
In passing arguments to main, we put two variables as the argument of the main function.
first argument is the argument count (argc).
second argument is the argument vector (argv). This vector is an array of string.
The main fuction will then look like thi:
int main(int argc, char* argv[]){}.
